# Final paper

## 1. Professional interests of myself

Since my undergrad is majored in electrical engineering, my current interest is trying to combine my interests in music with computer technologies in some creative way so that I might be able to create music with the assistance from innovative software/hardware. 

This semester I have read some papers about introducing machine learning technology to the fields of music production and music generation. Specifically, I have learnt about some useful tools and libraries created and published by Google Magenta project, such as Melody RNN, Coconet, NSynth, MusicVAE, etc. Take Melody RNN for example: since music is naturally in a sequential structure, which fits well with the structure of recurrent neural network (RNN), which has a chain-like loop structure that allows information learned in the previous loop to persist, we might be able to take use of this special structure to mimic some human mental activities. And RNN does have shown huge progress in the fields such as speech recognition, language modeling, translation and image captioning. Music, if we regart it as some sort of a language in a broader way, might also benefit from the power of RNN, so models such as Melody RNN and performance RNN are created in hope of being used as creative tools by musicians in the coming future. I will keep exploring this field of making music with the power of the emering new technologies.
